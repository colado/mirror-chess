# mirror-chess
mirror-chess is a prototype for a variant of chess where each piece of the board is linked to its equivalent piece at the other side of the board (i.e., black right bishop is connected to left black bishop). Each move on a piece moves also its linked piece in its determined direction and can make it capture whatever piece is at the end of the move. The only movement that breaks the sync is using the pawn to capture.

The project is in progress and needs some mechanics implemented.
